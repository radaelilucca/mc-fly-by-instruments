<p align="center" style="text-align: center;">An addon for <b>Create Aeronautics</b></p>

<p align="center" style="background-color: #F4ECD0; text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radaelilucca/mc-fly-by-instruments/main/docs/gallery/section-titles/what_it_is.png" alt="WHAT IT IS?" width="267"></p>

Flying a Create Aeronautics ship is great until a mountain shows up out of the fog,
or you try to land and have no idea how far the ground still is. **Fly by Instruments**
adds avionics: sensor blocks you mount on your craft that measure the world around it
and turn what they see into **redstone signals** and **CC:Tweaked data**.

Wire them into a lamp, a bell, a Create contraption or your own flight computer, and
your ship can warn you, or react on its own, before you hit something.

Every sensor works **on a moving ship** as well as on the ground. It turns and tilts with
your ship, never mistakes your own hull for an obstacle, and spots terrain, buildings
and other ships alike.

Want a real cockpit? The **experimental avionics suite** adds an **Avionics Computer** that
turns your sensors into a ground proximity warning system, a **Modular Table** for warning
lamps, buzzers and a flight management system, and **wires** to tie it all together.

Three sensor blocks, each with a different job and each recognizable at a glance.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/2106/625/preview-bottom-png.png" alt="Radar Altimeter" width="200"></p>

### Radar Altimeter

**Tells you how high you are above whatever is below you.** Mount it with the glass lens
facing down and it keeps track of the ground under your ship, without being fooled by a
lone tree or lamp post.

- The **higher you fly, the stronger the signal.** You choose the altitudes where it starts
  and where it maxes out: a landing light that dims as you touch down, an alarm when you
  drop below your cruise floor, whatever you need.
- Sees up to **128 blocks** down.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/2106/627/preview-png.png" alt="Terrain Scanner" width="200"></p>

### Terrain Scanner

**Watches what's ahead of you.** Point the nozzle where you're going and it keeps an eye
on everything in front of the ship.

- The **closer the obstacle, the stronger the signal.** You choose how far out it starts
  warning you and how close is "too close". Nothing ahead, no signal.
- The signal comes out of every side, so it's easy to wire.
- Works mounted on a ceiling too. It still looks forward.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/2106/626/preview-png.png" alt="Advanced Terrain Scanner" width="200"></p>

### Advanced Terrain Scanner

**Watches ahead *and* to the sides, separately.** Three lenses for three directions:
**Front**, **Left** and **Right**, each with its own warning distance and its own signal.

- Widen or narrow its view, from a tight beam straight ahead to a half-circle sweep.
- Each direction has its own side of the block: front from the front, left and right from
  the sides. Wire "obstacle left" and "obstacle right" to different lamps, bells or
  steering.
- Left and right only wake up once the view is wide enough to see them.
- Crafted by upgrading a regular Terrain Scanner.

### The avionics suite (Experimental)

These blocks are in the creative tab **without recipes**, and they may still change between
versions. Try them, but don't rely on them in a world you care about yet.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radaelilucca/mc-fly-by-instruments/main/docs/gallery/renders/avionics-computer.png" alt="Avionics Computer" width="300"></p>

#### Avionics Computer

**A ground proximity warning system for your ship.** Connect it to your sensors and it
watches them all, then warns you before you fly into trouble.

- Warns about **terrain ahead**, **pull up**, a **fast descent**, **losing height** after
  takeoff, flying **too low** and **banking too steeply**.
- **Set it up once, then it just works:** no arming, no thresholds to tune. Pick a
  sensitivity and switch off the functions you don't want.
- A small screen on the front blinks amber or red with the alert. Press its button for a
  self-test.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radaelilucca/mc-fly-by-instruments/main/docs/gallery/renders/modular-table.png" alt="Modular Table with modules" width="300"></p>

#### Modular Table

**Your cockpit panel.** A brass-and-wood slab with a 3 × 3 grid where you install modules.

- **Warning lamps** (1×1 and 2×1, red or amber) and a **buzzer** show the computer's
  alerts. Click a lit lamp to silence the alarm, like a Master Warning.
- The **FMS** module stores waypoints and shows a compass to the selected one. Link an
  **FMS Compass** to it and an Aeronautics Navigation Table follows your route.
- Tables placed side by side join into one big panel. A table mounted straight on the
  Avionics Computer is connected to it with no wire at all.

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radaelilucca/mc-fly-by-instruments/main/docs/gallery/renders/avionics-wire.png" alt="Avionics Wire between an Avionics Computer and a Terrain Scanner" width="400"></p>

#### Avionics Wire

**Real wires, not blocks.** Mount brass **Wire Connectors** on your devices and iron
**Wire Supports** along the hull, then run a black wire through them.

- The wire hangs with a gentle sag and bends neatly through each support.
- A ghost wire shows you the path, the length and the cost before you click.
- Press **V** for the **Wiring View**: every wire shows through the hull, coloured by
  whether its network is working.

**Right-click a sensor** to open its output screen.

- **Range slider:** drag the two handles to set where the output starts and where it
  reaches its maximum. The caption tells you exactly what you'll get, for example
  *"15 at 4 m → 0 at 32 m"* (1 block = 1 m).
- **Block faces:** by default, the signal comes straight out of the sensor. Put redstone,
  a lamp or a Create component next to it and you're done.
- **Redstone Link:** fill both frequency slots of a channel and that channel is broadcast
  through **Create's Redstone Link** instead. Your sensor can sit on the hull while the
  receiver sits in the cockpit. Pick frequency items without consuming them, straight
  from your inventory (or drag from JEI). The screen shows each channel's state: *Block
  faces*, *Via Link* or *Incomplete pair*.
- **Advanced Scanner:** use the **Front / Left / Right** tabs to give each channel its own
  range and frequencies, and the **Aperture** slider to set the opening.

> **Heads up:** on the Advanced Scanner, once one channel uses Redstone Link, the whole
> sensor switches to Link. Give every channel you want to use a frequency pair.

**Setting up the avionics suite:**

1. Place an **Avionics Computer** and connect it to a Radar Altimeter (required) and any
   Terrain Scanners with Avionics Wire.
2. Open each Terrain Scanner and set **Looks at** to the side of the ship it watches.
3. Mount a **Modular Table** and install lamps and a buzzer. They show the computer's
   alerts right away.

> **Heads up:** the computer never guesses which way a scanner faces. A Terrain Scanner
> without a **Looks at** side does not count as looking ahead.

**Sensors can't see into unloaded chunks.** A beam that reaches one simply doesn't count,
so very long ranges near the edge of the loaded world may read less than you expect.

Every sensor is a **CC:Tweaked peripheral** of its own. Put a computer next to it, or
connect it with a wired modem, and read the raw data:

| Peripheral | Readings | Events |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `radar_altimeter` | `getReading()`: status and altitude in blocks | `radar_altimeter_reading_changed` |
| `terrain_scanner` | `getScan()`: every contact, with distance and direction | `terrain_scanner_scan_changed` |
| `terrain_scanner_advanced` | Same as above, plus `getConfiguration()` and `setOpeningAngle(degrees)` | Same as above, plus `terrain_scanner_configuration_changed` |
| `avionics_computer` *(Experimental)* | `getStatus()`, `getSensors()`, `getAlerts()`, plus sensitivity, inhibit and self-test | `avionics_alert_changed`, `avionics_status_changed`, `avionics_sensors_changed` |
| `modular_table` *(Experimental)* | Installed modules, lamp and buzzer indications, FMS waypoints | `modular_table_changed`, `modular_table_alert_outputs_changed` |

All three also expose their redstone setup: `getOutputs()`, `getOutputConfiguration()`,
`setOutputRange(channel, min, max)` and `setLinkFrequencies(channel, first, second)`.

```lua
local altimeter = peripheral.find("radar_altimeter")

while true do
  local _, _, reading = os.pullEvent("radar_altimeter_reading_changed")
  if reading.status == "valid" and reading.value < 6 then
    print("TOO LOW! " .. math.floor(reading.value) .. " m")
  end
end
```

Yes. These server config options apply to every sensor in the world:

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `radarAltimeterMaxRange` | 128 | Maximum altimeter range, in blocks (1–4096) |
| `terrainScannerMaxRange` | 128 | Maximum scanner range, in blocks (1–4096) |
| `sensorScanIntervalTicks` | 5 | How often sensors take a new sample, in ticks |

Longer ranges and shorter intervals cost more server time on big fleets.

For the experimental avionics suite:

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxAvionicsNetworkBlocks` | 4096 | Largest avionics network, in connectors and devices |
| `wireMaxSpan` | 24 | Longest wire span between two points, in blocks |
| `wireMaxPoints` | 32 | Points per wire, ends included |
| `wireBlocksPerItem` | 8 | Blocks of wire made by one Avionics Wire item |
| `lampLightLevel` | 5 | Light given off by a lit table lamp (0 turns it off) |
