# Development

## Baseline

- Java 21
- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.236
- Create 6.0.10+
- Create Aeronautics bundled 1.3+
- Sable 2.0.5
- CC:Tweaked 1.120.0+
- R-UI Lib 0.5.0+

The Gradle properties default to the Create, Create Aeronautics, and Sable JARs
used by the sibling `sable-horses` workspace. The CC:Tweaked 1.120.0 JAR is
staged at `libs/cc-tweaked-1.21.1-neoforge-1.120.0.jar` and can be overridden
with `-Pcomputercraft_jar=<path>` if needed.

Aeronautics and Sable are supplied to Gradle as local development dependencies
and are not bundled into the addon JAR. Their nested JARs are extracted to
`build/local-mod-dependencies/` for compile-time symbols only.

## Commands

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
.\gradlew.bat runClient
```

VS Code tasks for both commands are in `.vscode/tasks.json`.

## Release scope

The current release ships three sensors with recipes: `radar_altimeter`,
`terrain_scanner` and `terrain_scanner_advanced`. Every other block and item
(Modular Table and its modules, FMS, Avionics Cable, Network Bridge and GPWS
Computer) stays registered and functional, but is marked **(Experimental)** in
its name, has no recipe and is only available from the creative tab or `/give`.
